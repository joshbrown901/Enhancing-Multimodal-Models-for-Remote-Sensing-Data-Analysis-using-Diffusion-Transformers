## Abstract
This paper presents an enhanced approach to remote sensing data analysis using multimodal
models, focusing on the integration of diffusion transformers (DiT). We propose several
architectural modifications to improve the fusion of multimodal data, specifically in remote
sensing, by introducing modality-specific encoders and attention regularization. Our experimental
evaluation, conducted on the SEN12MS dataset, demonstrates that our proposed architecture
achieves significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art (SoTA) models, particularly in
accuracy and F1-score. The practical implementation of our model is available on GitHub,
showcasing a clear performance boost. Future research directions are also discussed, highlighting
potential for further enhancements.

## I.Introduction
The field of remote sensing has undergone a transformative change with the adoption of deep
learning techniques, especially in multimodal data analysis. Remote sensing data typically comes
in various modalities, such as spectral bands (RGB, Near-Infrared), temporal sequences, and
spatial resolutions. This presents a challenge of fusing such diverse data sources effectively [1].
Multimodal learning approaches fuse different data modalities, critical for accurate decisionmaking 
in remote sensing tasks. However, traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs),
while effective for spatial data, struggle when applied to multimodal inputs due to their limited
ability to capture cross-modality dependencies [2].
The emergence of Transformer architectures, with their powerful attention mechanisms, offers a
solution to these challenges by capturing long-range dependencies [3]. Furthermore, the recent
introduction of Diffusion Models, known for their ability to model noise progressively, provides
a novel way of generating data representations, motivating our exploration of Diffusion
Transformers (DiT) in multimodal remote sensing tasks [4].
In this paper, we propose an improved DiT architecture for multimodal data analysis, focusing on
modality-specific encoders and attention regularization, leading to enhanced performance in the
fusion of diverse data modalities. We aim to demonstrate that this combination can outperform
existing SoTA models on complex remote sensing tasks.
